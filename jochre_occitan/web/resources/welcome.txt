 <p>Welcome to the CLLE-ERSS laboratory's Jochre Occitan Training Corpus,
 using Jochre, an open-source Java OCR application.
   Jochre allows you to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on PDF or image files.
  </p>
  <p>Jochre is a statistical OCR analyser, and bases its analysis on a training corpus.
  The version of Jochre on the present web application has been trained for Occitan.
  The analysis is performed using the <a href="http://maxent.sourceforge.net/howto.html">OpenNLP Maxent</a>
  Maximum Entropy package.
  </p>
  <p>If you encounter a document which scans particularly badly, please send it to the Jochre Occitan team,
  as it's a good candidate for diversifying the training corpus. This usually occurs because
  the document has either an unusual font, or an unusual spelling convention,
  or an unusual page layout which the pre-processor doesn't yet handle very well.</p>
  <p>You can either use Jochre simply to analyse files and download the results, or you can help
  build the Occitan corpus, thus ensuring more accurate results for the entire user community,
  by correcting the results directly on the web application.</p>
  <p>If you would like to setup a Jochre corpus for another language, you may download the source code
  or contact me for help.</p>
