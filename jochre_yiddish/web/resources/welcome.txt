 <p>Welcome to Jochre, an open-source Java OCR application.
   Jochre allows you to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on PDF or image files.
  </p>
  <p>Jochre is a statistical OCR analyser, and bases its analysis on a training corpus.
  The version of Jochre on the present web application has been trained for Yiddish.  The 
  training corpus contains a number of extracts from documents in the
  <a href="http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/yiddish-books">Yiddish Book Center's archive</a>. 
  This means it is optimised for books within this archive (all of whose scans are black-and-white 600dpi).
  Other document types (e.g. grayscale, lower resolution) may or may not analyse well, although the software
  has been written to be as document and language neutral as possible.
  The training corpus has been broken up into 3 sections: for each document, we typically have 4 pages of training,
  1 page held-out for model optimisation, and 1 page for final testing.
  Currently, the Jochre Yiddish model has a measured accuracy of 98.5%, that is,
  on the held-out corpus, an average of 98.5 out of every 100 characters have been correctly recognised.
  The analysis is performed using the <a href="http://maxent.sourceforge.net/howto.html">OpenNLP Maxent</a>
  Maximum Entropy package.
  </p>
  <p>If you encounter a document which scans particularly badly, please send it to the Jochre Yiddish team,
  as it's a good candidate for diversifying the training corpus. This usually occurs because
  the document has either an unusual font, or an unusual spelling convention (e.g. aleph tsere instead of ayin),
  or an unusual page layout which the pre-processor doesn't yet handle very well.</p>
  <p>You can either use Jochre simply to analyse files and download the results, or you can help
  build the Yiddish corpus, thus ensuring more accurate results for the entire user community,
  by correcting the results directly on the web application.</p>
